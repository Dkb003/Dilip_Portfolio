## [Project 1:Strategic Location For Resturant:](https://github.com/Dkb003/Strategic-Location-For-Resturant) Project Overview
Our client seeks to establish a franchised Asian restaurant, with a niche in Southeast Asian cuisine, in a Toronto neighborhood. Which neighbourhood would appear to be the optimal and most strategic location for the business operations? We use Clustering Algorithm to locate the optimal neighborhood for Opening a Asian Resturant.Our foundation of reasoning would be based on spending power, distribution of ethnic group, and competition, across each neighbourhood.We will mainly be utilizing the Foursquare API and the extensive geographical and census data from Toronto’s Open Data Portal. Please see the results below
